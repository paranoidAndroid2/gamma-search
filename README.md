gamma-search
============

Meta internet search engine comprising of Google, Bing and Blekko APIs.

Results from these REST APIs are aggregated according to a variation of the Comb-MNZ algorithm.

Results can also be clustered according to the k-means algorithm. This is done using search result snippets and therefore it doesn't have enough input data to be consistently accurate.
